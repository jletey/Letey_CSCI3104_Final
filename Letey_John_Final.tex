\textsl{Given an array $\{a_1, a_2, \cdots; a_n\}$, a reverse is a pair $(a_i, a_j)$ such that $i < j$ but $a_i > a_j$. Design a divide-and-conquer algorithm with a run-time of $\mathcal{O}(n\log(n))$ for computing the number of reverses in the array. Your solution to this question needs to include both a written explanation and a Python implementation of your algorithm, including:}
\begin{enumerate}
% ----------------------------  PART 1A  -----------------------------------
\item[(a)]\textsl{Explain how your algorithm works, including pseudocode.}\\ \\
The run-time of this algorithm has to be $\mathcal{O}(n\log(n))$, and the algorithm has to be a divide-and-conquer algorithm, so I took a hint and decided to build my algorithm off of the Merge-Sort Algorithm (since it has both the run-time requirement and the algorithm type requirement). Thus, I'm going to have use the same reasoning as the Merge-Sort Algorithm. Here is the pseudocode for the Merge-Sort Algorithm (note that this pseudocode was taken from the book):
\begin{lstlisting}
// The Merge-Sort Algorithm
Merge-Sort(A, p, r)
  if p < r
    q = floor((p + r)/2)
    Merge-Sort(A, p, q)
    Merge-Sort(A, q + 1, r)
    Merge(A, p, q, r)
\end{lstlisting}
I have to modify the above pseudocode for the function \texttt{Merge-Sort} to be able to return the number of reverses in the array. I will also modify the pseudocode for the Merge procedure. Here is some pseudocode (also taken from the book) for the Merge procedure:
\begin{lstlisting}
// The merge procedure
Merge(A, p, q, r)
  n1 = q - p + 1
  n2 = r - q
  let L[1 ... n1+1] and R[1 ... n2+1] be new arrays
  for i = 1 to n1
    L[i] = A[p + i - 1]
  for j = 1 to n2
    R[j] = A[q + j]
  L[n1 + 1] = infinity
  R[n2 + 1] = infinity
  i = 1
  j = 1
  for k = p to r
    if L[i] <= R[j]
      A[k] = L[i]
      i = i + 1
    else 
      A[k] = R[j]
      j = j + 1
\end{lstlisting}
The pseudocode for the \texttt{Merge} procedure won't need a lot of changes. All I need to do is add a counter for it to return. I will also be getting rid of lines 8 and 9 of the pseudocode. All I need to modify in the \texttt{merge} and \texttt{Merge-Sort} algorithms is add counters. I added a counter to sum up all of the reverses in the current recursive call, and another counter in the "\texttt{merge}" function, in the else statement when $L[i]>R[j]$, which is exactly what we want.

\textsl{Suppose that you are assigned a task to do a survey about $n$ important issues (such as education policy and health insurance mandate), by asking a group of $m$ persons questions about these issues. Suppose that a person may not have an opinion about all the issues, and you can ask a person about an issue only if s/he has an opinion about it. We use a bipartite graph $G = \{P \cup I, E\}$ to capture whether a person $p \in P$ has an opinion about an issue $i \in I$ or not: $(p, i) \in E$ means that $p$ has an opinion about $i$. For each issue $i$, in order to have a reliable survey you need to ask at least $l_i$ persons about it, but you may have certain budget constraint so that you can only ask at most $u_i$ persons about it.

% ----------------------------  PART 5C  -----------------------------------
\item[(c)]\textsl{Prove that your algorithm is correct. Your proof needs to include specific features of your algorithm.}\\ \\
Let's use induction for this proof. Let's first define the predicate $f(m)$ to be the predicate that there is a survivor whenever $2m + 1$ people stand in the field (and each person throws a balloon at their nearest neighbor. To prove this, we'll need to show that the predicate $f(m)$ is true for all integers $m$ that are positive. \\ \\
\textbf{Base Case:} $m = 1$ \\
When $m = 1$ there are $n = 2m + 1 = 3$ people on the field. Suppose $d(i, j)$ is the distance between people $i$ and $j$. We can assume, without any loss of generality, that $d(1, 2) < d(1, 3) < d(2, 3)$. Thus persons 1 and 2 both throw to each other, and person 3 throws to person 1. This means that person 3 is never hit. \\
\textbf{Inductive Step:} Assume that the predicate $f(k)$ is true for an arbitrary integer k. Prove that the predicate $f(k + 1)$ is true. \\
Suppose that we have $n = 2(k + 1) + 1 = 2k + 3$ people on the field with distinct distances between people. Let's define person 1 and 2 to be two people that will both throw to each other (they're each other's nearest neighbor). Thus, we have two cases: \textit{Case 1}, where another person throws a balloon at either person 1 or person 2, or \textit{Case 2}, where no other person throws a balloon at either person 1 or person 2 \\ \\
\textit{Case 1:} Because person 1 and person 2 throw balloons at each other, and someone else (person 3) throws a balloon at either person 1 or person 2, there are 3 balloon thrown in total between persons 1, 2, and 3. This implies at most $2k$ balloons are thrown at the remaining $2k + 1$ people, because we had $2k + 3$ balloons to start with. Therefore, there must be at least one person remaining because we don't have enough balloons. \\ \\
\textit{Case 2:} Other than person 1 and person 2, there are $2k + 1$ people on the field. Because the distances are all distinct between pairs of neighbors, we can use the inductive hypothesis to say that there is at least one survivor that wasn't hit. \\ \\ 
Thus, $f(k + 1)$ also holds.
% ----------------------------  PART 5D  -----------------------------------
\item[(d)]\textsl{Analyze the runtime behavior of your algorithm.}\\ \\
By looking at the above algorithm, you can clearly see that my algorithm has runtime $\boxed{\mathcal{O}(n^2)}$, where $n$ is the number of people on the field.
